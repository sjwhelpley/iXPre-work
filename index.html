                    Welcome to my pre-work for the iX Full-Stack Coding Course!
                    I am an incoming junior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer and Information
                    Science and I am so excited to begin this adventure. I love to travel and learn, so once I got accepted
                    to iX, I knew this was the perfect opportunity for me. I first started creating websites my junior year of high school
                    and I cannot wait to learn more and expand my skills. Being able to type and create something other people could use was the coolest to me.
                    Since then, I have only discovered more about the endless possibilites technology and creativity can bring about.

                    I am a flute and piccolo player, and am in my university's marching and concert bands! We have traveled to Penn State, Charlotte, North Carolina, and El Paso, Texas together in my first two years
                    for various football games. The video below is our pregame performance for our bowl game in El Paso on New Years Eve of this past year! There is little I love more than running out onto the field 
                    - yes, we do a run cadence out of the tunnel through a cloud of smoke! The people I have met in music are truly amazing and I could not imagine where I would be today without those experiences in my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love camping and traveling, having been to a number of United States national parks. I hope to visit all of them one day!
                    I have been to a couple of countries in Europe for a wind symphony concert tour I was in, but I never imagined myself visiting
                    Cape Town. I am so excited I get the chance to explore such a beautiful place.
